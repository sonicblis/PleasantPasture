<img class="border" style="float: left; width: 40%; margin-right: 10px;" alt="Soap on Display" src="/img/display.jpg">
We're so excited to be able to offer goat milk soap made from our own, on farm, hand milked goats.  We worked for months on a recipe that
we are incredibly excited about (and use daily ourselves).  Our natural soap offers you all of the benefits of goat milk as you wash.  Your hands, your hair,
and your body can all enjoy the nourishing properties of goat milk that incorporated into our heavenly scented bars of chemical free delight.

We use a combination of oils to produce a complex combination of moisturizing goodness.  We use the highest quality
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phthalate" target="_blank">phthalate</a> free oils to scent our soap.  We then hand pour each batch and hand cut each bar,
ensuring that you get the highest quality bar of soap we make every time.  We love our skin (and we're fond of yours) which is why we put so much care
into providing a bar of soap we believe will delight you and your skin.<br><br>
<h2>What are the benefits of Goat Milk Soap?</h2>
<img class="right border" src="/img/bars.jpg" alt="Soap!">
Goat milk contains skin nourishing Vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin C.  It also contains some B vitamins, amino acids, and citric acids, mixed in with a bit
of unsaturated fatty acids and zinc.  I know, right?  Makes you want to jump in a goat milk bath as soon as possible, but while that might not be possible,
the next best thing is.  Your skin likes these things and you could be satisfying those cravings every time you wash.  All this mixed with natural creams in
goat milk and proteins that kill acne-causing bacteria means good times for your sensitive skin.  If you're interested in finding out how to come across a bar
yourself, stop by the Farm on Saturdays from 10:00AM to 2:00PM and get your own bar for only $5.99.<br><br>
