<h2>At Pleasant Pasture, we love our animals.</h2>
...but sometimes, on a plate.  We're committed to providing food the way nature intended for it to be enjoyed.  We want to keep our animals happy, our land healthy,
and the food we produce as delicious as possible.  We're committed to quality and wouldn't dream of selling anything we didn't believe in and enjoy ourselves on a regular basis.  We'd love to get to know you.
You can keep up with the latest news on our Facebook page.  So, if you want food that will surprise you with each bite, click on a product above and find out some details about what we're doing and how you can
get involved.  If you'd like, contact us with any questions you have about what we're doing.<br /><br />

<h2 style="width: 313px; margin-left: 182px;">Natural Resourcefulness</h2>
Our family is committed to the care of our animals and to an environment in which they thrive.  We're focused on the optimal amount they can produce, not the maximum.  We do our best to provide a stress free,
healthy environment that keeps them happy, not just alive.  That's because we have no doubt that happy animals produce better food.
<br /><br />
We've been doing this for years now and it's amazing.  Come by the farm on Saturdays from 10:00 to 2:00 to see how we do things.  We have no secrets and we're proud of how we care for our animals
and collect and package our food.  We would love for you to see the difference it makes when you work with nature instead of against her.

We work hard every day to care for our animals and collect amazing
food.  We don't use chemicals in our farming and raise our animals
on as much grass as possible.  This means they have a lot more food
that is exactly what they were born to eat and they love it.  As a result, they produce some of the best tasting, vitamin rich, healthy, clean food you can get and we love it.  We think you will too,
so use our form over on the right to let us know what you think.<br /><br /><br />
