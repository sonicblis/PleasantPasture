<h2>What are Pastured eggs?</h2>
<p>
    <img src="/img/happyhens.png" width="90" class="left" style="margin-right: 10px;">Pastured eggs are eggs that are layed by hens that have access to real,  fresh pasture grass on a daily basis.
    Although a diet of bugs, worms,  insects, as well as herbs, grass and seeds doesn’t sound appealing to  us, to
    a hen, it’s a heavenly buffet.  Making sure our hens are moved to  get as much as they can eat on a daily basis
    makes a difference. We augment with only <a href="http://www.nongmoproject.org/learn-more/" target="_blank">non-GMO</a> feed.
</p>
<h2>So, are these the same as free range?</h2>
<p>
    <img src="/img/sadhens.png" width="90" class="left" style="margin-right: 10px;">Not even close.  Chickens can do amazing things to grassy land.  They  fertilize it, break it up, rid it of parasites,
    and do all sorts of other good  things.  However, in doing so, they can also make it a barren wasteland fairly quickly.
    Free range chickens are often just hens that are free of  cages, but that spend most of their time in the same area, which
    usually means no more grass, no more bugs, and none of the healthy things chickens love.

<h2>What are the benefits of pastured eggs?</h2>

    <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Real-Food/2007-10-01/Tests-Reveal-Healthier-Eggs.aspx" target="_blank">Some</a>
    <a href="http://www.smallfootprintfamily.com/benefits-of-pasture-raised-eggs" target="_blank">reports</a> have shown that pastured eggs can have 1/3 less cholesterol,  1/4 less saturated fat, 2/3 MORE vitamin A,
    2 times the omega-3 fatty  acids, 3 times more vitamin E, and up to 7 times more beta carotene.
    The bright color of the yolks indicates the significantly higher beta  carotene levels and the taste is much better in our experience (though <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=pasture%20egg%20test&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0CFsQFjAG&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seriouseats.com%2F2010%2F08%2Fwhat-are-the-best-eggs-cage-free-organic-omega-3s-grocery-store-brand-the-food-lab.html&amp;ei=cJwjULrtDITciQLn3oCoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWn_vw6iVttq3dx0sJ2hDU-fGdDw" target="_blank">some would disagree</a> with the objectivity of that).
    We would love for you to come by and get a dozen to find out for yourself.  We believe you'll agree that the difference is so significant, that there's no going back, but don't take
    our word for it.
