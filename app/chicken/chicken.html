    From the day our chicks arrive in the mail (yes, in the mail), we give them the luxury spa treatment.  Whether relaxing all day in their brooder for the first few weeks, lazing away
    their day under a heat lamp, or when they've moved out to the grassy fields of our farm, they certainly have a good life.  We get our birds 50 at a time and from the moment they arrive,
    they are pampered.  <br><br>

    Well, up until that fateful day at least.  After our birds are eight to twelve weeks old, they have a processing day.  On processing day, we butcher our own birds as humanely as we can.
    We've studied the latest techniques being used by sustainable farmers to produce the best chicken meat we think you can get your hands on.<br><br>

    <h2 style="clear: both;">What do they eat?</h2>

    Did you know chickens love to eat grass and bugs?  I know it's hard to believe because of how gross both sound to us, but believe me, it's true.  We make sure that our chickens are
    moved to new grass daily and get the grass and bugs they want in order to become a wonderful meal, and this is the key.  There are no shortcuts to producing high quality, healthy chicken.
    We currently raise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Ranger_(chicken)" target="_blank">Freedom Rangers</a>, a slow growing broiler.

    <h2 style="margin-right: 170px;">How do you prepare them?</h2>
    We process all of our birds on farm and take care to make sure the meat is as tender, fresh, and delicious as possible.  We sell them as whole birds,
    sealed in bags and ready to cook.  We sell them for $4.99 a pound and they run between 4 to 7 lbs.  If you're interested in reserving a bird in our next batch or
    purchasing one that has recently been processed, use the form on the right to let us know.
